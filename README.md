# ChatApp
I have created an Online Broadcast chat using NodeJS and SocketIO

You can find the relevant codes in ChatApp folder and you can run it via first creating a server using the command "node index.js" from nodeServer folder (let it run until you complete your testing) and then opening index.html as usual.
